# tendon-leg-designs
A repository for all the 3D printed parts required to make a robotic leg with two bi-articular tendons. Assembly instructions below.

## 3D Printing
All parts successfully print after slicing in PrusaSlicer, and then printing with generic PLA on the Prusa i3 MK3 with MMU2 attachment. After printing, supports must be removed from each object. For joints that will house bearings, please sand the holes until a bearing can be pressed in rather easily.

Some important print settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Support | Everywhere |
| Detect bridging parameters | Enabled |
| Infill pattern | Rectilinear |
| Interface pattern spacing | 1mm |
| XY seperation between an object and its support | 80% |
| Interface layers | 2 |
| Infill | 100% |
| Print bed tempertature | 60°C |
| Nozzle tempertature | 220°C |

## Assembly
The parts in this repository can be used to make either an articulated robotic leg, or a passive one.
