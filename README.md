# tendon-leg-designs
A repository for all the 3D printed parts required to make a robotic leg with two bi-articular tendons. Assembly instructions below.

## 3D Printing
All parts successfully print after slicing in PrusaSlicer, and then printing with generic PLA on the Prusa i3 MK3 with MMU2 attachment. Some important print settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Support | Everywhere |
| Detect bridging parameters | Enabled |
| Infill pattern | Rectilinear |
| Interface pattern spacing | 1mm |
| XY seperation between an object and its support | 80% |
| Interface layers | 2 |
| Infill | 100% |
| Print bed tempertature | 60°C |
| Nozzle tempertature | 220°C |

## Assembly
The parts in this repository can be used to make either an articulated robotic leg, or a passive one.
